# Git_learning
This is he repo I have done for learning Git and GitHub

Here I have cloned the repo from github repository into my local using clone command 
and I am writing this to show what will happen when you clone and change in the local. It shows "M" beside the file name in editor and it is called Modified. 

And if you create anything new in this folder "U" will be shown beside which is Untracked. the git is not tracking this file and is not aware that it is created

You can check the status for this using status command
